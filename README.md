# secure-audit

okay, today is a new day on my one project daily aim, and i am trying to build a smart contract audit tool. i noticed people i taught in 2021 became a big deal in just 18 months of work. the universe rewards those who put in their efforts and try their best.

to be honest, i have to perfect everything with the yarn setup and then i setup docker for this to work efficiently.
