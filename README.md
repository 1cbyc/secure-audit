# Secure Audit - Smart Contract Security Scanner

A comprehensive smart contract security scanner that provides professional-grade auditing capabilities for Solidity smart contracts.

## Features

### Security Vulnerability Detection
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Unprotected selfdestruct calls
- tx.origin usage vulnerabilities
- Unchecked external calls
- Weak randomness sources
- Missing access control
- Dangerous delegatecall usage

### Gas Optimization Analysis
- State variable packing opportunities
- Memory vs storage efficiency
- Loop optimization suggestions
- Potential gas savings calculations

### Code Quality Assessment
- Missing documentation detection
- Magic number identification
- Function complexity analysis
- Best practices compliance
