Building a comprehensive Smart Contract Security Scanner that provides professional-grade auditing capabilities. Here's what the scanner includes:

Key Features:

Security Vulnerability Detection:

    Reentrancy attacks
    Integer overflow/underflow
    Unprotected selfdestruct calls
    tx.origin usage vulnerabilities
    Unchecked external calls
    Weak randomness sources
    Missing access control
    Dangerous delegatecall usage

Gas Optimization Analysis:

    State variable packing opportunities
    Memory vs storage efficiency
    Loop optimization suggestions
    Potential gas savings calculations

Code Quality Assessment:

    Missing documentation detection
    Magic number identification
    Function complexity analysis
    Best practices compliance

Professional Interface:

    Real-time code analysis
    Severity-based risk scoring
    Detailed recommendations
    Sample vulnerable contract for testing
    Comprehensive reporting dashboard

How to Use:

    Paste Contract Code: Input your Solidity contract in the left panel
    Scan Analysis: Click "Scan Contract" to run the security audit
    Review Results: Examine vulnerabilities, optimizations, and quality issues
    Test with Sample: Use "Load Sample" to see the scanner in action with a deliberately vulnerable contract

The scanner uses pattern matching to identify common vulnerability patterns and provides actionable recommendations for each issue found. It assigns risk levels and provides a comprehensive security score to help prioritize remediation efforts.

This tool would be valuable for developers, auditors, and security researchers working with smart contracts.
